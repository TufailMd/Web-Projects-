                <div class="coding-desc"><p>My journey into coding began during my early teenage years when I was captivated by problem-solving and the logic behind computer programs. I vividly remember the excitement of creating my first program in C, which sparked my passion for software development. This passion has only grown over the years as I delved deeper into programming languages, algorithms, and building projects from scratch.</p></div>

                    During my college years at Parul Institute of Engineering and Technology, I began exploring web development and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My first major project was designing a responsive portfolio website to showcase my work, which cemented my interest in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites.

                    Currently, I am enhancing my knowledge in web development and learning advanced tools and technologies like React and JavaScript frameworks.

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing football and cricket, exploring books like Atomic Habits, and spending time honing my interpersonal and communication skills. My journey so far has been a blend of curiosity, hard work, and an unending drive to learn and grow.
