    <h3>Early Life and Background</h3>
    <hr class="border border-danger border-2 opacity-50">
    <div class="el">

His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker at a transport firm, and his mother, Purnima Sharma, is a homemaker. Financial constraints during his early life meant that Rohit was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali, Mumbai. He was later admitted to a cricket academy thanks to his uncle's financial support, which marked the beginning of his cricketing journey.

      Rohit's prodigious talent became evident during his school days. His coach, Dinesh Lad, recognized his potential and encouraged him to switch from off-spin bowling to batting. The decision proved crucial to his career.</p></div>
